# Cyber Defense Lab - Cybersecurity Training Simulation

An interactive, browser-based training platform designed to teach fundamental cybersecurity concepts through gamified simulations.

## Modules

1. **Phishing Intelligence Analysis**: Identify sophisticated email-based threats, including CEO fraud, typosquatting, and social engineering.
2. **Threat Hunter: Process Monitor**: A real-time system monitoring simulation. Identify and terminate malicious processes to maintain system stability.
3. **Cryptography Lab**: Explore the history of encryption with an interactive Caesar Cipher decoder.
4. **Password Brute-Force Simulator**: Understand the relationship between password entropy and the time required for automated cracking.
5. **Social Engineering Defense**: Engage in a simulated chat to identify psychological manipulation and data harvesting techniques.
6. **Digital Forensics**: Audit a virtual workstation to identify security leaks, misplaced credentials, and misconfigured permissions.
7. **Security Awareness Trivia**: Test your knowledge on critical security topics like MFA, Zero-Day vulnerabilities, and Ransomware.

## Technical Details

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for high performance and zero dependencies.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A clean, tile-based grid layout for rapid access to all security modules.
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Unified dark theme with neon accents and terminal-inspired UI components.
- **Extensive Content**: Over 60+ unique educational scenarios across 7 interactive modules.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive CSS Grid layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Real-time Process Monitor**: Custom simulation engine for the Threat Hunter module.

## Research Context

This project demonstrates a "Learn-by-Doing" approach to cybersecurity education. Research shows that interactive simulations improve retention rates for technical concepts compared to passive reading. Each module is designed to provide immediate feedback, reinforcing correct security behaviors.
