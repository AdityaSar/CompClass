# Cyber Defense Lab - Cybersecurity Training Simulation

An interactive, browser-based training platform designed to teach fundamental cybersecurity concepts through gamified simulations.

## Modules

1. **Phishing Intelligence Analysis**: Identify sophisticated email-based threats, including CEO fraud, typosquatting, and social engineering.
2. **Network Firewall Defender**: A real-time simulation of network traffic filtering. Protect the system core by allowing safe data and blocking threats.
3. **Cryptography Lab**: Explore the history of encryption with an interactive Caesar Cipher decoder.
4. **Password Brute-Force Simulator**: Understand the relationship between password entropy and the time required for automated cracking.
5. **Security Awareness Trivia**: Test your knowledge on critical security topics like MFA, Zero-Day vulnerabilities, and Ransomware.

## Technical Details

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for high performance and zero dependencies.
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Unified dark theme with neon accents and terminal-inspired UI components.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Real-time Game Engine**: Custom animation loop for the Firewall Defender module.

## Research Context

This project demonstrates a "Learn-by-Doing" approach to cybersecurity education. Research shows that interactive simulations improve retention rates for technical concepts compared to passive reading. Each module is designed to provide immediate feedback, reinforcing correct security behaviors.
