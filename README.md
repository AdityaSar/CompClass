# Cyber Defense Lab - Cybersecurity Training Simulation v4.2.0

An interactive, browser-based training platform designed to teach fundamental cybersecurity concepts through gamified simulations.

## Modules

1. **Phish or Legit?**: Detect sophisticated social engineering and email-based threats.
2. **Threat Hunter**: A real-time system monitoring simulation. Identify and terminate malicious processes.
3. **Crypto Lab**: Decode secret historical messages with an interactive Caesar Cipher decoder.
4. **Password Vault**: Test brute-force cracking speeds and understand password entropy.
5. **Security Trivia**: Challenge your general knowledge on critical security topics.
6. **Social Engineering**: Identify human manipulation tactics in a simulated chat environment.
7. **Digital Forensics**: Audit a system for data leaks, misplaced credentials, and misconfigured permissions.

## Technical Details

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for high performance and zero dependencies.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A clean, tile-based grid layout for rapid access to all security modules.
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Unified dark theme with neon accents and terminal-inspired UI components.
- **Extensive Content**: Over 60+ unique educational scenarios across 7 interactive modules.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive CSS Grid layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Real-time Process Monitor**: Custom simulation engine for the Threat Hunter module.

## How to Run

1.  **Access**: Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No server or dependencies required.

## Research Context

This project demonstrates a "Learn-by-Doing" approach to cybersecurity education. Research shows that interactive simulations improve retention rates for technical concepts compared to passive reading. Each module is designed to provide immediate feedback, reinforcing correct security behaviors.
